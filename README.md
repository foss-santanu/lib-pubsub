# pubsub-queue
An interface for a pubsub provider and an in memory implementation

The work is *in progress*. But the basic structure of my code has been properly laid out. The code is complete with unit test cases that run without failure.

I am using Clojuresque as the build tool. Please refer to my blog post [Clojure with Emacs 23](https://programmerscratchpad.wordpress.com/2015/04/11/clojure-with-emacs-23/) for details on the *build.gradle* build file.

All the functionalities of a pubsub provider are not implemented yet but the codebase can be used as a reference to programming in Clojure.
